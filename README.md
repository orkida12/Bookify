# Bookify â€“ Library Management System

Bookify is a desktop-based Library Management System developed using Java and JavaFX, implemented as part of the coursework for the Object-Oriented Programming subject at Epoka University. The system provides basic functionalities for managing books, users, and borrowing processes in a structured and intuitive manner.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of the project was to apply object-oriented design principles in a real-world scenario, using Java and JavaFX to simulate a simplified digital library environment. The system allows users to perform essential operations such as managing book records, user registration, and tracking borrow/return activities, with persistent data storage through file handling mechanisms.

## Core Features

- Book registration, editing, and deletion  
- User registration and management  
- Borrowing and returning of books  
- File-based data storage (no external database)  
- JavaFX-based graphical user interface  

## Technologies and Tools

- Java SE (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- JavaFX (UI development)  
- FXML (JavaFX layout markup)  
- SceneBuilder (for FXML visualization, optional)  
- File I/O (TXT/CSV-based storage system)  

## Contributors

This project was developed collaboratively by the following students:

-Ziko Muca - Orkida Gjeli  - Suljon Pashaj  - Rosilda Bajrami  

## Future Enhancements

To improve the scalability and maintainability of the system, the following enhancements are considered:

- Integration with a relational database (e.g., MySQL or SQLite)  
- User authentication and role-based access control  
- Report generation in PDF/CSV formats  
- Overdue tracking and automated notifications
